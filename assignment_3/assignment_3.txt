Desired grade: A

Motivation:
We are aware of that we're missing the optional feature with a timer and making helpers assembly. However, we think that
our implementation of the features we did implement are of high quality. Furthermore, the we have tried to
keep the code clean by having comprehensive naming conventions instead of excessive comments.
A quick guide to reoccuring code and more complicated solutions are also provided in the top of snake.asm to help with understanding.
We also added speed increase and functionality to avoid apples from spawning inside the snake, on top of other apples and on the border.
The program is also well optimized by making use of registers instead of memory where possible, and cutting operations to a
minimum to the best of our ability.
